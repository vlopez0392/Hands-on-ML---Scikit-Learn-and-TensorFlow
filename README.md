# Hands-on-ML-Scikit-Learn-and-TensorFlow
This repository contains the projects, exercises and examples found in the book __Hands-on-ML-Scikit-Learn-and-TensorFlow__ by 
Aurelien Geron.

In this book, Python, pandas, Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow are used to solve problems in ML and DL, thus, the main purpose 
of this repository is to show and archive my learning process. Whenever necessary, I will go beyond to what's written in the book by adding useful facts from the Pandas and Scikit-Learn documentation such that other inexperienced learners (such as myself) have a simpler time understanding the contents of the book and these awesome tools!

Hoping that you find this repository very useful! Please notice I just started solving this book (as of 31/05/2019) so I will keep 
updating it in these upcoming months.
